1.Using Abstract we can not achieve multiple inheritance but using an Interface we can achieve multiple inheritance.
2.We can not declare a member field in an Interface.
3.We can not use any access modifier , public , private , protected , internal etc. because within an interface by default everything is public.
4.An Interface member cannot be defined using the keyword static, virtual, abstract or sealed.
5.An Abstract class doesn't provide full abstraction but an interface does provide full abstraction.
6.An Interface only contains method and property prototypes.
7.The most important difference between Interfaces and Abstract Classes is the semantic difference.An Interface defines what something can do , and an Abstract Class defines what something is.
